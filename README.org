*NOTE: This package is in very early stages. I'm using it regularly, but many improvements need yet to be made, especially in being more extensible in various ways.*

* Guix Sudoloop Pull Ups
Guix pull and update with sudoloop. Elisp code which creates and runs shell scripts to more efficiently update Guix with sudoloop (for =guix system reconfigure=) and multiple attempts to counteract transient timeouts/failure, so full guix updates are less painful.

* How to Install
[to be filled out more fully...]
** With Elpaca
add to =init.el=

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package guix-sudoloop-pull-ups
  :ensure (:host github :repo "emacsomancer/emacs-guix-sudoloop-pull-ups"))
#+end_src

** Notes
*** Sudoloop
The sudoloop'ing part of the shell code is taken pretty much directly from Clar Fon's implementation [https://codeberg.org/clarfonthey/sudoloop] (licensed under CC0 licence).
